Answer:
I will first parse the input CSV to identify the rows and their values. Then, I will check if the value is a direct number or a formula. If it's a formula, I'll implement logic to evaluate the expression, update the CSV with the result, and continue processing.


Question 2: What types of errors would you check for?
Answer:
Invalid formulas (e.g., =A1+B3 where A1 or B3 is missing).
Invalid cell references (e.g., non-existent cells).
Non-numeric values in cells where numbers are expected.
Syntax errors in formulas.
Circular references in formulas (e.g., A1 = B2 and B2 = A1).


Question 3: How might a user break your code?
Answer:
Inputting invalid formulas, such as formulas that reference non-existent cells or incorrectly formatted expressions.
Leaving required values (e.g., numeric values) empty or undefined.
Creating circular dependencies in formulas where cells reference each other in a loop.
